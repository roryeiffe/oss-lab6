1. Testing additional words:

(Only had to change main). 

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    G = words_graph()
    print("Loaded words_dat.txt containing 5757 five-letter English words.")
    print("Two words are connected if they differ in one letter.")
    print("Graph has %d nodes with %d edges"
          % (nx.number_of_nodes(G), nx.number_of_edges(G)))
    print("%d connected components" % nx.number_connected_components(G))

    for (source, target) in [('chaos', 'order'),
                             ('nodes', 'graph'),
                             ('moron', 'smart'),
                             ('files', 'swims'),
                             ('mango', 'peach'),
                             ('pound', 'marks')]:
        print("Shortest path between %s and %s is" % (source, target))
        try:
            sp = nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)
            for n in sp:
                print(n)
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
            print("None")
```

Output:
