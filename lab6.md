## Question 1: Testing additional words:

(Only had to change main). 

### Code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    G = words_graph()
    print("Loaded words_dat.txt containing 5757 five-letter English words.")
    print("Two words are connected if they differ in one letter.")
    print("Graph has %d nodes with %d edges"
          % (nx.number_of_nodes(G), nx.number_of_edges(G)))
    print("%d connected components" % nx.number_connected_components(G))

    for (source, target) in [('chaos', 'order'),
                             ('nodes', 'graph'),
                             ('moron', 'smart'),
                             ('files', 'swims'),
                             ('mango', 'peach'),
                             ('pound', 'marks')]:
        print("Shortest path between %s and %s is" % (source, target))
        try:
            sp = nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)
            for n in sp:
                print(n)
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
            print("None")
```

### Output:

```

## Question 2: 4-letter words:

(Only had to change main and words_graph()).

### Code:

```python
def words_graph():
    """Return the words example graph from the Stanford GraphBase"""
    fh = gzip.open('words4_dat.txt.gz', 'r')
    words = set()
    for line in fh.readlines():
        line = line.decode()
        if line.startswith('*'):
            continue
        w = str(line[0:4])
        words.add(w)
    return generate_graph(words)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    G = words_graph()
    print("Loaded words4_dat.txt containing 2174 four-letter English words.")
    print("Two words are connected if they differ in one letter.")
    print("Graph has %d nodes with %d edges"
          % (nx.number_of_nodes(G), nx.number_of_edges(G)))
    print("%d connected components" % nx.number_connected_components(G))

    for (source, target) in [('cold', 'warm'),
                             ('love', 'hate'),
                             ('good', 'evil'),
                            ('pear','beef'),
                             ('make','take')]:
        print("Shortest path between %s and %s is" % (source, target))
        try:
            sp = nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)
            for n in sp:
                print(n)
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
            print("None")
```

### Output:

```
Loaded words4_dat.txt containing 2174 four-letter English words.
Two words are connected if they differ in one letter.

```

## Question 3: Unordered

### Code:
```python
def generate_graph(words):
    G = nx.Graph(name="words")
    lookup = dict((c, lowercase.index(c)) for c in lowercase)

    def edit_distance_one(word):
        # iterate through word:
        for i in range(len(word)):
            # extract out the current character
            c = word[i]
            # get the index of the current character (a -> 0, b -> 1, etc...)
            j = lookup[c]  # lowercase.index(c)
            # make a set of all characters in word:
            word_set = set(word)
            # loop through every letter that comes after this current letter
            for cc in lowercase[j + 1:]:
                new_word = word + cc
                # find all permutations of this word and the additional letter:
                perms = itertools.permutations(new_word,5)
                for item in perms:
                    # only if we have a different letter:
                    if item != word_set:
                        # Yield this permutation:
                        perm = "".join(item)
                        yield perm
        
    candgen = ((word, cand) for word in sorted(words)
               for cand in edit_distance_one(word) if cand in words)
    G.add_nodes_from(words)
    for word, cand in candgen:
        G.add_edge(word, cand)
    return G


def words_graph():
    """Return the words example graph from the Stanford GraphBase"""
    fh = gzip.open('words_dat.txt.gz', 'r')
    words = set()
    for line in fh.readlines():
        line = line.decode()
        if line.startswith('*'):
            continue
        w = str(line[0:5])
        words.add(w)
    return generate_graph(words)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("started")
    G = words_graph()
    print("Loaded words_dat.txt containing 5757 five-letter English words.")
    print("Two words are connected if they differ in one letter.")
    print("Graph has %d nodes with %d edges"
          % (nx.number_of_nodes(G), nx.number_of_edges(G)))
    print("%d connected components" % nx.number_connected_components(G))

    for (source, target) in [('chaos', 'order'),
                             ('nodes', 'graph'),
                             ('moron', 'smart'),
                             ('files', 'swims'),
                             ('mango', 'peach'),
                             ('pound', 'marks')]:
        print("Shortest path between %s and %s is" % (source, target))
        try:
            sp = nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)
            for n in sp:
                print(n)
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
            print("None")
```
